# Overview

As we know, `trait` is an important feature of Rust.
It is similar to "base classes" or "interfaces" in other languages such as Dart.

`flutter_rust_bridge` has support to automatically translate `trait`s.
In short, just write down traits and `impl` blocks as usual, and flutter_rust_bridge will automatically convert them.
The following pages are needed only if you need to do something complicated or flutter_rust_bridge's default behavior is not sufficient.

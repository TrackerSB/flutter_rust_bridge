# Ignoring functions

Sometimes you may want functions not to be translated by flutter_rust_bridge.

Firstly, if it is private, i.e. not `pub`, it will automatically be ignored.

Secondly, if it is public but still needs to be ignored,
you can use the attribute `#[frb(ignore)]` to ignore it.
For example:

```rust
#[frb(ignore)]
pub fn ignored_in_frb() {
  println!("you should not see ignoredInFrb in dart side.");
}
```

This feature also supports methods. For example:

```rust
struct RandomStruct;
impl RandomStruct {
  pub fn ignored_in_frb() {
    println!("you should not see ignoredInFrb within RandomStruct in dart side.");
  }
}
```

Currently `#[frb(ignore)]` doesn't support enums and structs yet - feel free to open an issue if your scenario needs it.
